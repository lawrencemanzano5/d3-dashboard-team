# d3-dashboard-team

This was originally for a university CPSC course group project after the assessment phase of the individual dashboard variations created by each member. This final rendition is based off of my variation (please see my "d3-dashboard-solo" repo) with added interactivity between and within the charts.
Note that not all of the code related to the interaction functionality is my work, but simply the ones related to the heatmap and parallel axes chart.

Please see github pages deployment to view project.
